This is the collaboration lab

User A: Atul Lanka/Timothy Park
User B: Liang Hao/Timothy Park

Task 1: We used the basics of git cloning in order to make the repository local for both user, so that both contributors can push and pull updated files without difficulty. 

Task 2: We got an error because both users tried to edit and push the same file simultaneously.  

Task 3: By creating a new branch and mergin its files with the master branch, mulitple users were able to edit and push the same file
